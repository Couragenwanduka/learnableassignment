  <hi>Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it</h1>
  <p>Rebase is one of two Git utilities intended for merging changes from one branch into another. Essentially, it involves taking one branch and appending it to the end of another branch, with the “end” being represented by the latest commit in the branch.In this command, "base" refers to the branch or commit to rebase the current branch onto. This command takes the changes from the current branch and applies them on top of the specified base branch or commit.<p>

<h1>Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it </h1>
<p>git cherry-pick in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch. This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebases which normally apply many commits into another branch.

git cherry-pick is just like rebasing, an advanced concept and also a powerful command. It is mainly used if you don’t want to merge the whole branch and you want some of the commits.</p> </article></div>
